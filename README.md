# My system's dotfiles (WIP)
My system/tools' configuration. I'm a developer and Linux lover. Maybe you'll find things of interest in there.

## i3:
- Contains my i3config file as well as my bar config and a cheat sheet.

## vim:
- Contains my vimrc as well as a cheat sheet of vim, my bindings and my plugins.
- Install vundle first:

`$ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

## tmux:
- Contains my tmux.conf file as well as the same kind of cheat sheet as for the others configs.
- (Also a theme file for the tmux bar.)

## zshrc:
- It's just my zshrc file, with all my aliases, configs and plugins. (OhMyZsh)

## ranger:
- My config files for ranger. Also, surprise, a cheat sheet!
	- rc.conf: setting various options, biding keys to functions.
	- commands.py: functions in Python to modify its behaviour.
	- rifle.conf: default programs for opening files.
	- scope.sh: shell script to generate file previews.
	- bookmarks
- WIP

- Once again, the config file and the cheat sheet that goes with it.

- Folder for the config: $HOME/.config/syncthing/...
